# Drifter's Atlas
An Interactive Map for Hyper Light Drifter

# How to use it
You can open it, itll automatically read the save files from your AppData folder.<br>
Or, you could simply drag and drop your own file and it will read it just as fine.<br>
Then the controls are as follows;
- WASD/Arrow Keys to move
- Q/Numpad1 = Zoom In
- E/Numpad2 = Zoom out
- R/Numpad3 = Go Underground

# Additional Info.
